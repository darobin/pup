      <p>
        Privacy is an essentially contested concept [[?PRIVACY-CONTESTED]]. Its debated meaning
        render its support problematic in the context of a standards-setting process grounded in
        consensus [[?W3C-PROCESS]], in seeking out technical solutions grounded on shared
        requirements, and in addressing the needs of a worldwide constituency. This document
        provides definitions for privacy and related concepts that are suitable for a global
        audience, that can provide building blocks for privacy threat modelling, and can guide the
        development of the Web as a trustworthy platform. In the spirit of building a much-needed
        bridge between technology and policy, this document is written under the expectation that
        it can apply to both.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy is essential to trust, and trust is a cornerstone value of the Web [[?RFC8890]].
        In much of everyday life, people have little difficulty assessing whether a given flow of
        information constitutes a violation of privacy or not [[?NYT-PRIVACY]]. However, in the digital
        space, users struggle to understand how their data may flow between contexts and how such
        flows may affect them, not just immediately but at a much later time and in completely
        different situations. Some actors then seize upon this confusion in order to extract and
        exploit personal data at unprecedented scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this document is to define all the terms that may prove useful in developing
        technology and policy that relate to privacy and personal data. It additionally provides
        several frameworks that address the common need that is privacy threat modelling, the
        frequent debate over consent, and the under-developed set of issues in privacy that are of a
        collective, relational nature.

      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <p>
        This section provides a number of elementary building blocks from which to establish a
        shared understanding of privacy. A significant portion of the definitions below build atop
        the discontinued work in <em>Tracking Preference Expression (DNT)</em> [[tracking-dnt]].

        <h2>People &amp; Data</h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn>user</dfn> (also <dfn data-lt="persons">person</dfn> or <dfn>data subject</dfn>) is any natural
          person.
        </p>
        <p>
          We define <dfn>personal data</dfn> as any information relating to a [=person=] such
          that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            this [=person=] is identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an
            identifier such as a name, email address, an arbitrary identifier or identification
            number, an online identifier such as an IP address or any identifier attached to a
            device this [=person=] may be using, phone number, location data, or factors specific
            to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity
            of that [=person=], as well as identifiers derived from such data, for instance
            through hashing; or
          </li>
          <li>
            this [=person=] could reasonably be reidentified from a conjunction of this data with
            other data; or
          </li>
          <li>
            the data pertains to a group of people such that a [=person=] may find themselves to
            be the subject of a treatment related to this group, even if the entity carrying out the
            treatment has no way to identify that [=person=].
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Data is <dfn>permanently de-identified</dfn> when there exists a high level of confidence
          that no human subject of the data can be identified, directly or indirectly (e.g., via
          association with an identifier, user agent, or device), by that data alone or in
          combination with other retained or available information, including as being part of a
          group. Note that further considerations relating to groups are covered in the
          <a href="#collective">Collective Issues in Privacy</a> section.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn data-lt="vulnerable">vulnerable person</dfn> is a [=person=] who, at least in the [=context=] of
          the [=processing=] being discussed, are unable to exercise sufficient
          self-determination for any consent they may provide to be receivable. This includes for
          example children, employees with respect to their employers, people in some situations of
          intellectual or psychological impairment, or refugees.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>The Parties</h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn>party</dfn> is a [=person=], a legal entity, or a set of legal entities that
          share common owners, common controllers, and a group identity that is readily evident to
          the [=user=] without them needing to consult additional material, typically through
          common branding.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn data-lt="first parties">first party</dfn> is a [=party=] with which the [=user=] intends to
          interact. Merely hovering over, muting, pausing, or closing a given piece of content does
          not constitute a [=user=]'s intent to interact with another party, nor does the simple
          fact of loading a [=party=] embedded in the one with which the user intends to
          interact. In cases of clear and conspicuous joint branding, there can be multiple [=first
          parties=]. The [=first party=] is necessarily a [=data controller=] of the data processing
          that takes places as a consequence of a [=user=] interacting with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn data-lt="third parties">third party</dfn> is any [=party=] other than the [=user=],
          the [=first party=], or a [=service provider=] acting on behalf of either the [=user=] or
          the [=first party=].
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>service provider</dfn> or <dfn>data processor</dfn> is considered to be the same
          [=party=] as the entity contracting it to perform the relevant [=processing=] if it:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            is processing the data on behalf of that [=party=];
          </li>
          <li>
            ensures that the data is only retained, accessed, and used as directed by that [=party=]
            and solely for the list of explicitly-specified [=purposes=] detailed by the directing
            [=party=] or [=data controller=];
          </li>
          <li>
            may determine implementation details of the data processing in question but does not
            determine the [=purpose=] for which the data is being [=processed=] nor the overarching
            [=means=] through which the [=purpose=] is carried out;
          </li>
          <li>
            has no independent right to use the data other than in a [=permanently de-identified=]
            form (e.g., for monitoring service integrity, load balancing, capacity planning, or
            billing); and,
          </li>
          <li>
            has a contract in place with the [=party=] which is consistent with the above limitations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A <dfn>data controller</dfn> is an entity that determines the [=means=] and [=purposes=]
          of data processing. Any party that is not a [=service provider=] is a [=data controller=].
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>Vegas Rule</dfn> is a simple implementation of privacy in which "<em>what happens
          with the [=first party=] stays with the [=first party=]</em>." Put differently, it
          describes a situation in which the [=first party=] is the only [=data controller=].
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Acting on Data</h2>
        <p>
          A [=party=] <dfn data-lt="process|processing|processed|data processing">processes</dfn> data if it
          carries out operations on [=personal data=], whether or not by automated means, such as
          collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration,
          retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, [=sharing=], dissemination or
          otherwise making available, [=selling=], alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or
          destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          A [=party=] <dfn data-lt="share|sharing">shares</dfn> data if it provides it to any other
          [=party=]. Note that this definition allows a [=party=] to provide that data to its own
          [=service providers=].
        </p>
        <p>
          A [=party=] <dfn data-lt="sell|selling">sells</dfn> data when it [=shares=] it in exchange
          for consideration, monetary or otherwise.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Contexts and Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The <dfn>purpose</dfn> of a given [=processing=] of data is an anticipated, intended, or
          planned outcome of this [=processing=] which is achieved or aimed for within a given
          [=context=]. A [=purpose=], when described, should be specific enough to be actionable by
          someone familiar with the relevant [=context=] (ie. they could independently determine
          [=means=] that reasonably correspond to those being effectively deployed).
        </p>
        <!--
          XXX given that contexts are defined from *user* purpose we might wish to have purpose in
          general and processing purpose for the above.
        -->
        <p>
          The <dfn>means</dfn> are the general method of [=data processing=] through which a given
          [=purpose=] is implemented, in a given [=context=], considered at a relatively abstract
          level and not necessarily all the way down to implementation details. Example:
          <em>the user will have their preferences restored (purpose) by looking up their identifier
          in a preferences store (means)</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>context</dfn> is a physical or digital environment that a [=person=] interacts with
          for a purpose of their own (that they typically share with other [=person=] who interact
          with the same environment).
        </p>
        <p>
          A [=context=] can be further described through:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Its <dfn>actors</dfn>, which comprise the <dfn>subject</dfn> (a [=person=]) as well as
            the <dfn>sender</dfn> and <dfn>recipient</dfn> of the data (which are [=parties=]).
          </li>
          <li>
            Its <dfn>attributes</dfn>, which are the types of [=personal data=] being [=processed=]

          A [=context=] carries <dfn>context-relative informational norms</dfn> that determine

          (if the norms are adhered to) or <dfn data-lt="inappropriately">inappropriate</dfn>
          (when the norms are violated). A norm violation can be for instance the exfiltration of
          [=personal data=] from a context or the lack of respect for [=transmission principles=].
        </p>
        <p>
          We define <dfn>privacy</dfn> as a right to [=appropriate=] [=data processing=]. A

          [[?PRIVACY-IN-CONTEXT]].
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that a [=first party=] can be comprised of multiple [=contexts=] if it is large
          enough that [=persons=] would interact with it for more than one [=purpose=]. [=Sharing=]
          [=personal data=] across [=contexts=] is, in the overwhelming majority of cases,
          [=inappropriate=].

            Your cute little pup uses <em>Poodle Naps</em> to find comfortable places to snooze,
            and <em>Poodle Fetch</em> to locate the best sticks. Napping and fetching are different
            [=contexts=] with different norms, and sharing data between these contexts is a
            [=privacy violation=] despite the shared ownership of <em>Naps</em> and <em>Fetch</em>

        <h2>User Agents</h2>
        <p>
          The <dfn>user agent</dfn> acts as an intermediary between a [=user=] and the web. The
          [=user agent=] is <em>not</em> a [=context=] in that it is expected to coincide with the
          [=subject=] and operate exclusively in the [=subject=]'s interest. It is <em>not</em> the
          [=first party=]. The [=user agent=] serves the [=user=] in a
          <dfn data-lt="fiduciary relationship">relationship of fiduciary agency</dfn>: it always puts
          the [=user=]'s interest first, up to and including, on occasion, protecting the [=user=]
          from themselves by preventing them from carrying out a harmful decision, or at the very
          least by speed-bumping it. For example, the [=user agent=] will make it difficult for the
          [=user=] to connect to a site the authenticity of which is hard to ascertain, will double-check that
          the user really intends to expose a sensitive device capability, or will prevent the
          [=user=] from consenting to permanent monitoring of their behaviour. Its <dfn>fiduciary
          duties</dfn> include [[TAKING-TRUST-SERIOUSLY]]:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt><dfn>Duty of Protection</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            Protection requires [=user agents=] to affirmatively protect a [=user=]'s data, beyond
            simple security measures. It is insufficient simply to encrypt at rest and in transit,
            but one must further limit retention, ensure that the strictly necessary data is
            collected, or require guarantees from those it is shared to.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Duty of Discretion</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            Discretion requires the [=user agent=] to make best efforts to enforce
            [=context-relative informational norms=] by placing contextual limits on the flow and
            [=processing=] of [=personal data=]. Discretion is not confidentiality and may place
            limits on nondisclosure: trust can be preserved even when the [=user agent=] shares the
            [=personal data=], so long as it is done in an [=appropriately=] discreet manner.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Duty of Honesty</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            Honesty requires that the [=user agent=] make sure that the [=user=] is proactively
            provided with information that is relevant to them and that will enhance the [=user=]'s
            autonomy, to the extent possible in a manner that they will comprehend and at the right
            moment, which is almost never when the [=user=] is trying to do something else such as
            read a page or activate a feature. The duty of honesty goes well beyond that of
            transparency that dominates legacy privacy regimes. Unlike with transparency, honesty
            cannot get away with hiding relevant information in complex out-of-band legal notices
            no more than it can rely on overly cursory information provided in a consent dialog.
          </dd>
          <dt><dfn>Duty of Loyalty</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
            Because of the special [=fiduciary relationship=] that obtains between [=user=] and
            [=user agent=], the latter is held to be loyal to the former in all situations, up to and
            including in preference to the [=user agent=] implementer. When a [=user agent=] carries
            out [=processing=] that is not directly in the [=user=]'s interest but rather benefits
            another entity such as its implementer, that behaviour is known as <dfn>self-dealing</dfn>.
            [=Self-dealing=] is always [=inappropriate=]. Loyalty is the avoidance of [=self-dealing=].
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          These duties ensure the [=user agent=] will <em>care</em> for the user. It is important to
          note that there is a subtle difference between care and <dfn>data paternalism</dfn> which
          is that the latter purports to help in part by removing agency ("<em>don't worry about it,
          so long as your data is with us it's safe, you don't need to know what we do with it, it's
          all good because we're good people</em>") whereas care aims to support people by enhancing
          their agency and sovereignty.

      <h2>Privacy Threat Model Building Blocks</h2>
      <section>
        <h2>Threats Are Context-Relative</h2>
        <p>
          Privacy threat models for the Web exist ([[?TRACKING-PREVENTION-POLICY]], [[?ANTI-TRACKING-POLICY]],
          [[?PRIVACY-THREAT]]). While good within the scope of what they intend to do, they tend to be
          very specific to cross-context tracking as seen by the browser, which is but one problem.
          Privacy threat modelling could benefit from having more of a toolbox to reuse in different
          situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This section provides some building blocks for the creation of <dfn>privacy threat models</dfn> on
          the Web. Note that privacy threat models have an important difference with security threat
          models in that <em>all</em> [=parties=] are potential threats, even when they are not rogue.
          In fact the [=first party=] is typically considered to be the primary threat, the one
          against which the brunt of mitigating techniques are to be leveraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important building blocks for a privacy threat model are those that define a
          [=context=]: [=actors=], [=attributes=], and [=transmission principles=], as well as the
          [=context-relative informational norms=]. Collectively, these define the expectations that
          obtain in a given [=context=]. Based on these expectations, it becomes possible to ask
          questions about the ways in which they could fail and how to prevent. What happens if the
          [=subject=] is a [=vulnerable person=]? How well does the context fare if expectations of
          consent are undermined by manipulative techniques [[?DIGITAL-MARKET-MANIPULATION]]?
          If the [=transmission principles=] are based on sharing data with parties while telling
          them that they cannot use it, what confidence do we have that they are following the rules?
        </p>
        <p>
          When assessing privacy threats, it is not necessary to establish harms since breaking the
          [=context=]'s norms is [=inappropriate=] in all cases. However, consideration of harms can
          inform which issues to prioritise. Where individual harms are concerned, the definitive
          source is <em>Privacy Harms</em> [[?PRIVACY-HARMS]].
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Identity on the Web</h2>
        <p>
          Only the most powerful can afford to have the same identity across contexts without
          adverse consequences. Identity is by nature fragmented, and [=user agents=] must work in
          support of [=users=] having different identities in different [=context=] and to prevent
          their recognition. The more [=vulnerable=] one is, the more important it is to fragment
          identities; supporting recognition across contexts is oppressive as it forces
          vulnerability into the open. [=User agents=] should actively prevent identification
          across [=contexts=], including where their own vendors are concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind, one threat to user privacy and trust on the Web is the use of email for
          [=purposes=] beyond login and direct communication with the user. Email is often used as a
          login key, and has the valuable property that it can then be used for transactional
          messaging as well as for newsletters and direct marketing (where respectful). It is,
          however, increasingly being reused in order to recognise [=users=] across [=contexts=] to
          track and target them in [=inappropriate=] ways. This use is contrary to the expectation
          of users and leads to decreased trust which over time will lead users to shy away from
          providing their email even to sites that only use it for legitimate [=purposes=].
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to the Web that one can log into a site with full trust, without worrying
          that this will enable cross-context recognition, spam, or other [=inappropriate=] uses of
          data.
        </p>
      </section>

    <section>
      <h2>User Control and Autonomy</h2>
      <p>
        We need to start from a simple yet salient point: in today's data economy, complete informational
        self-determination is impossible. It is crucial not to confuse this fact, as others have
        before, with the contention that privacy is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        A second important point to keep in mind throughout this section is that increased choice is
        not increased autonomy ‚Äî and autonomy is what we seek. There is ample evidence that people's
        privacy preferences are malleable [[?PRIVACY-BEHAVIOR]] and that they are susceptible to
        manipulation [[?DIGITAL-MARKET-MANIPULATION]]. Users have scarce time and mental resources,
        and when presented with an interruptive decision as they try to accomplish a task such as
        reading an article or turning on a feature, they will tend to accept legal terms simply to
        dismiss them. The Web community discovered decades ago that such dialogs were terrible for
        security and has, to the extent possible, moved away from them. There is no reason to believe
        that the ActiveX model is any better at protecting privacy than it was at providing security.

        <!--
          - consent is bad for vulnerable subjects because it incentivises companies to NOT know
            that a given subject is vulnerable, in order not to be liable for it
          - outcomes versus means: increasing agency versus notice & choice
          - consent is comparable to the general problem of permissions on the Web platform. In the
            same way that it should be clear when a given device capability is in use (eg. you are
            providing geolocation or camera access), sharing data should be set up in such a way
            that it requires deliberate, specific action from the user (eg. triggering a form
            control) and if that consent is persistent, there should be an indicator that data is
            being transmitted shown at all times, in such a way that the user can easily swich it
            off. In general, providing consent should be rare, difficult, highly intensional, and
            temporary
            - the value in global opt outs

              - understanding global opt outs under consent regimes such as the GDPR
                - the GOO essentially conveys a preference for state, not for transition, so it will
                  opt you out if you ever are opted in

            types of data processing, they only place them under different procedural requirements.
          - one problem with procedural approaches to privacy is that they place the same
            requirements in situations where the parties operate under huge asymmetries of power
            ‚Äî for instance the user of an essential service provided by a monopolistic platform ‚Äî
            and parties that are very much on equal footing, or even where the data subject may have
            greater power, as is the case with small businesses operating in a competitive
            environment. It further does not consider cases in which one business may coerce other
            businesses into facilitating its extractive practices, as is often the case with

      <!--
        - legibility
        - data protection is all about the data, maybe it should be more about the people [[REL-TURN]]
        - the FIPs were designed for an area of databases, not for the data market and the data
          industrial complex. Individual privacy harms exist [[CITRON-SOLOVE]] but the collective
          aspects need focus too.
        - data can be used to decide what we see and what we prefer
          - "To govern is to make believe." ‚ÄîMachiavelli
        - second-wave colonisation: extractive practices with respect to countries that do not have
          significant data industrial presence
        - data markets, differential valuation, rivalrous + non-exludable
          - Acquisti 2014
          - Stucke 2017
          - Binns 2018

        - The "relational turn" considers the relation between the people who expose themselves and
          the entities that invite that disclosure. It's about power. One key understanding here is
          that, unlike traditional data protection, this relation persists even when data is
          anonymised since power can stem from an excessive, asymmetric understanding of cohorts.
          This is why data derived from individual data must itself be governed in some cases
          (which we need to define), even if deidentified. What makes an understanding excessive?
          That is a question for agency that might not entirely fit here.
        - Collective issues in data require collective solutions. The proper goal of data governance
          at the standards-setting level is the provision of institutions that can handle
          population-level problems in data, and it might not necessarily do so by increasing
          individual control over data.
        - mention Garuda as the outline of potential legitimate governance over data
        - Imagine a case in which collecting browser data can be leveraged to improve both search
          services (which have a business model) and user security (which generally doesn't). This
          data could be collected through a data trust under stakeholder governance, search
          companies paying for access with strong checks and balances, and privacy guarantees, and
          the funds would be used to support enhanced security for all.
