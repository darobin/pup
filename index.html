      <p>
        Privacy is an essentially contested concept [[?PRIVACY-CONTESTED]]. Its debated meaning
        render its support problematic in the context of a standards-setting process grounded in
        consensus [[?W3C-PROCESS]], in seeking out technical solutions grounded on shared
        requirements, and in addressing the needs of a worldwide constituency. This document
        provides definitions for privacy and related concepts that are suitable for a global
        audience, that can ground a methodology for privacy threat modelling, and can guide the
        development of the Web as a trustworthy platform. In the spirit of building a much-needed
        bridge between technology and policy, this document is written under the expectation that
        it can apply to both.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Privacy is essential to trust, and trust is a cornerstone value of the Web [[?RFC8890]].
        In much of everyday life, people have little difficulty assessing whether a given flow of
        information constitutes a violation of privacy or not [[?NYT-PRIVACY]]. However, in the digital
        space, users struggle to understand how their data may flow between contexts and how such
        flows may affect them, not just immediately but at a much later time and in completely
        different situations. Some actors then seize upon this confusion in order to extract and
        exploit personal data at unprecedented scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this document is to define all the terms that may prove useful in developing
        technology and policy that relate to privacy and personal data. It additionally provides
        several frameworks that address the common need that is privacy threat modelling, the
        frequent debate over consent, and the under-developed set of issues in privacy that are of a
        collective, relational nature.

    <section>
      <h2>User Control and Autonomy</h2>
      <p>
        We need to start from a simple yet salient point: in today's data economy, informational
        self-determination is impossible. It is crucially not to confuse this fact, as others have
        before, with the contention that privacy is dead.
      </p>
      <!--
        - increased choice is not increased autonomy
          - Acquisti on influence over privacy preferences
          - this is a good use of the Agnes Transparency & Choice meme
        - opt in, opt out, consent: a comparison
          - consent is bad for vulnerable subjects because it incentivises companies to NOT know
            that a given subject is vulnerable, in order not to be liable for it
          - outcomes versus means: increasing agency versus notice & choice
          - consent is comparable to the general problem of permissions on the Web platform. In the
            same way that it should be clear when a given device capability is in use (eg. you are
            providing geolocation or camera access), sharing data should be set up in such a way
            that it requires deliberate, specific action from the user (eg. triggering a form
            control) and if that consent is persistent, there should be an indicator that data is
            being transmitted shown at all times, in such a way that the user can easily swich it
            off. In general, providing consent should be rare, difficult, highly intensional, and
            temporary
        - FIPs
          - the FIPs put all the load on self-determination and therefore do not forbid specific
            types of data processing, they only place them under different procedural requirements.
          - one problem with procedural approaches to privacy is that they place the same
            requirements in situations where the parties operate under huge asymmetries of power
            ‚Äî for instance the user of an essential service provided by a monopolistic platform ‚Äî
            and parties that are very much on equal footing, or even where the data subject may have
            greater power, as is the case with small businesses operating in a competitive
            environment. It further does not consider cases in which one business may coerce other
            businesses into facilitating its extractive practices, as is often the case with
            dominant players in advertising or in content aggregation [[CAT]].
        - explain that there is no value in asking users about technical methods (eg. cookies) but
          only ever about purposes
        - the value in global opt outs
          - rectify automation asymmetry
          - essentially like having a robot click or convey opt out automatically for the user
          - understanding global opt outs under consent regimes such as the GDPR
            - the GOO essentially conveys a preference for state, not for transition, so it will
              opt you out if you ever are opted in
        - dark patterns
        - tiered models by context defined in standards
          - define legitimate interest based on CI. LI tends to be understood as "what we can get
            away with without having to rely on consent" instead of what legitimately matches the
            expectations and interests of both parties in a relationship. Add some relational, some
            fiduciary values to support it. In fact, LI could be grounded entirely in fiduciary
            values as expressed by Hartzog.

      <h2>Collective Issues in Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Tk
      </p>
      <!--
        - legibility
        - data protection is all about the data, maybe it should be more about the people [[REL-TURN]]
        - the FIPs were designed for an area of databases, not for the data market and the data
          industrial complex. Individual privacy harms exist [[CITRON-SOLOVE]] but the collective
          aspects need focus too.
        - data can be used to decide what we see and what we prefer
          - "To govern is to make believe." ‚ÄîMachiavelli
        - second-wave colonisation: extractive practices with respect to countries that do not have
          significant data industrial presence
        - data markets, differential valuation, rivalrous + non-exludable

        - The "relational turn" considers the relation between the people who expose themselves and
          the entities that invite that disclosure. It's about power. One key understanding here is
          that, unlike traditional data protection, this relation persists even when data is
          anonymised since power can stem from an excessive, asymmetric understanding of cohorts.
          This is why data derived from individual data must itself be governed in some cases
          (which we need to define), even if deidentified. What makes an understanding excessive?
          That is a question for agency that might not entirely fit here.
        - Collective issues in data require collective solutions. The proper goal of data governance
          at the standards-setting level is the provision of institutions that can handle
          population-level problems in data, and it might not necessarily do so by increasing
          individual control over data.
